# Smartphone captured retinal image assessment using enhancement and segmentation methods

This repository contains the code for a master's thesis project focused on glaucoma detection using smartphone-captured retinal images. The project includes three major components:

- **Segmentation** of the optic cup, disc, and blood vessels using SAM-based models  
- **Image enhancement** using an adapted Restormer architecture  
- **Glaucoma classification** using a modified ResNet18 model
